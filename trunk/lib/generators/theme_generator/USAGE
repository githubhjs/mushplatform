SYNOPSIS
     theme [theme_name]  (use _system_ to update theme system files only)

DESCRIPTION
     This generator creates general purpose theme support. It's designed to leverage
     webservers for the static content of the theme (images, stylesheets, javascripts, 
     etc).

     Included:
      - Abstraction of Typo style theme support
      - Tag helpers for accessing theme specific content
      - Support for overriding views in theme
      - Support for ERb templates and Liquid templates
      - Theme system can allow a mix of both template types, or Liquid templates only
      - Liquid tag for accessing theme specific content

EXAMPLE
     ./script/generate theme default

     This will generate the file structure for a theme named 'default' and prepare 
     the rails application for theme support. 

	  You can update the theme support files by running:

 	  ./script/generate theme _system_
